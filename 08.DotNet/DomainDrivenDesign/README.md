# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Project

## Overview

This project is structured around the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). DDD focuses on aligning software development with complex business needs, using a strategic and tactical approach.

## Commit History

### 1. Added DotNet/Domain Driven Design project

**DDD --> Tactical Patterns --> Entity**
- Introduced the concept of Entity within the DDD tactical patterns. Entities are objects that have a distinct identity that threads through time and different states.

### 2. Updated DDD project

**DDD --> Tactical Patterns --> Value Object and Repository**
- Added explanations and examples for Value Objects and Repositories. Value Objects are objects that describe aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity. Repositories manage the persistence of Entities and typically emulate a collection of objects.

### 3. Updated DDD project - Aggregate - Factory

**DDD --> Tactical Patterns --> Aggregate and Factory**
- Updated the project to include Aggregates and Factories. Aggregates are clusters of associated objects that we treat as a single unit for data changes. Factories handle the creation of complex objects, ensuring that created objects are always in a valid state.
