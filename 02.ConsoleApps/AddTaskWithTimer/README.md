# AddTaskWithTimer

Simple console app that lets you add tasks with a name, description, and how often they should pop up in the console (in milliseconds). It's built with .NET 8 and is pretty straightforward to use.

## How to Use

1. **Run the app:** Open your terminal, navigate to the app's folder and type `dotnet run`.
2. **Add tasks:** Follow the prompts to add your tasks. You'll need to provide a task name, a description, and a duration in milliseconds.
3. **Exit:** Type `exit` when you're done adding tasks.

That's all! Your tasks will start showing up in the console at the intervals you specified.

## Why This App?

It's a handy way to get reminders or notifications in your console, especially if you're already working in it and need to keep track of tasks without switching contexts.
