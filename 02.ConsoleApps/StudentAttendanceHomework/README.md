# Student Attendance Homework

Welcome to the Student Attendance Homework project! This is a simple console application designed to help you practice basic programming concepts.

## Overview

This project focuses on managing student attendance through a console application. You will be required to implement various functionalities, such as:

- Requesting the number of a student with an int check.
- Displaying an error if no int value is provided.
- Searching for the entered student number in the class.
- Displaying an error if there is no student with the entered number.
- Displaying a message if the student is present in class.
- Using arrays or lists for bonus tasks.
- Bonus Task: Avoid marking a student present if they are already marked, and throw an error.
- Bonus Task: If all students are marked present, the application should say "All students are present in class" and exit.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the `Program.cs` file to start the console application.
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the student attendance system.

## Bonus Tasks

For the bonus tasks, consider using arrays or lists to enhance your understanding of these data structures.

## Research Assignment

This project serves as a research assignment, providing an opportunity to:

1. Manage attendance processes easily in console applications.
2. Practice using if-else blocks and while loops more comfortably.
3. Gain a clear understanding of arrays and lists.

By working on this assignment, you'll have the chance to apply and reinforce the concepts explained in the research assignment.

Good luck with your homework!
