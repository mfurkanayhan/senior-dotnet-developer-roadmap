          There are 3 types of variables in JavaScript.
            var - An old definition method. Used to define function-scoped and reassignable variables. However, compared to let and const, it may cause scope issues.
            
            let - Used to define block-scoped and reassignable variables. It is valid only within the block it is defined.
            
            const - Used to define block-scoped and non-reassignable constants, meaning once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program. However, for mutable structures like objects or arrays, the content of a variable defined with const can be changed, but you cannot assign it to another value. (Here, the element itself is not changing, just the content is being updated.)
