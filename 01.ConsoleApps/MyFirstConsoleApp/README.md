This code example serves as a good starting point for beginners in programming, helping them understand variable types, scope, text operations, numerical operations, logical expressions, and date/time operations.

## Topics Covered

- **Scope:**
    - In programming, scope refers to the area where a variable, function, or object is accessible.
    - There are two types of scope: Global Scope and Local Scope.

- **Variables:**
    - Variables are used to store and manipulate data.
    - The syntax for variable declaration is: `type variable_name = value;`

- **string (Text):**
    - The string data type is used to represent text or character strings.
    - It can perform operations such as string concatenation, length measurement, and case conversion.

- **int (Integer):**
    - Integers are used to represent positive or negative whole numbers.
    - They are commonly used for mathematical calculations.

- **decimal, double, and float (Decimal Numbers):**
    - Decimal is used to represent decimal numbers with high precision, especially in financial applications.
    - Double and float are used to represent decimal numbers but with lower precision.

- **bool (Boolean):**
    - Bool data type represents only two values: "true" (correct) or "false" (incorrect).
    - It is used to represent logical expressions and conditions.

- **datetime (Date and Time):**
    - DateTime data type is used to represent date and time information.
    - It enables operations related to date and time, such as creating specific date-time instances, calculating time differences, and formatting dates.
