        // The above is a research assignment I've provided.
        // 1. It will allow us to manage this attendance process easily in console applications.
        // 2. It will help you use if-else blocks and while loops more comfortably.
        // 3. It will provide a clear understanding of arrays and lists, which I haven't shown yet.

        // This way, you'll practice what I've explained on your own.
