# Creating a project from scratch
Creating a Node.js project from scratch involves several straightforward steps:

## 1. Installing Node.js
Node.js is the runtime environment that allows you to execute your JavaScript code server-side. If it's not already installed on your computer, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website. The installation of Node.js also includes npm (Node Package Manager).

## 2. Creating a Project Folder
```
mkdir myNodeProject
cd myNodeProject
```
## 3. Initializing the package.json File
This file will contain your projectâ€™s dependencies and configurations. You can create it by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

```
npm init -y
```
The `-y` flag automatically fills in the default values for all options.

## 4. Installing Dependencies
Use npm to install libraries that you'll need for your project. For instance, if you're building a web server, you might want to install Express:
```
npm install express
```

## 5. Creating the Application File
Create the main file of your project (usually named `app.js`, `index.js`, or `server.js`) and add a simple web server code:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
## 6. Running the Application
To start your project, run the following command in the terminal:

```
node app.js
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to see the "Hello World!" message by navigating to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 7. Streamlining the Development Process
To automatically reflect any changes you make in your files directly on the server during development, you can install a tool like `nodemon`:

```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```
After installing `nodemon`, you can modify the `scripts` section in your `package.json` file to automate your development process:

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
}
```
With this setup, you can start your application using `nodemon` by running `npm run dev`. This will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the source files.
