# Classes
## Overview
This project serves as an introduction to Classes and Objects in C#. Classes are custom types that encapsulate data and functionality, serving as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of classes.

## Contents
The `Program.cs` file contains a simple `Person` class that demonstrates:

- **`Fields`**: Variables declared within a class to represent the data the object holds.
- **`Properties`**: A way to control the access to the fields within a class. Properties contain `get` and `set` methods for retrieving and assigning values.
- **`Constructors`**: Special methods that are called when a new instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize objects.
- **`Methods`**: Blocks of code that define behavior and actions that objects of the class can perform.

## Using the Code
To understand how classes work in C#:

Examine the Person class structure within the code.
Look at how the Person object is instantiated and used in the Main method.
Notice how properties are used to set and get field values.

## Running the Example
Compile and run the code using a C# development environment. The output will demonstrate object instantiation, property access, and method invocation.

## Conclusion
Classes form the foundation of object-oriented programming in C#. This project illustrates the basics, such as defining classes, creating objects, and using constructors, properties, and methods.
