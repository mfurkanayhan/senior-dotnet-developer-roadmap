# Methods
## Overview
Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called upon to execute when needed. This guide covers the definition, declaration, and use of methods in C#.

## Key Concepts of Methods
- **Declaration**: Defining the structure of a method, including its return type, name, and parameters.
- **Calling**: Invoking a method to perform its task.
- **Parameters**: Specifying inputs to methods, allowing for dynamic execution.
- **Return Types**: Determining what type of data a method returns, if any.

## Example Usage
The included `Program.cs` showcases:

- A method named `Add` that adds two integers and returns the sum.
- A method named `Subtract` that subtracts one integer from another and returns the difference.
- A method named `DisplayGreeting` that prints a greeting to the console and has no return value (void).

## Running the Example
To run the provided code:

1. Place the code into a C# project within an IDE or a C# file if using a compiler.
2. Compile and execute the program to see the results of the method calls.
3. Observe how each method is used and the output they produce.

## Conclusion
Understanding how to use methods is essential for organizing code, making it reusable, and breaking complex tasks into manageable pieces. Methods enable programmers to create more readable, maintainable, and testable code in C#.
