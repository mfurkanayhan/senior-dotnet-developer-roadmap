# Value Types And Reference Types
This document explains the basic differences between value types and reference types in C# through simple examples.


## Value Types
Value types hold data directly. Each variable has its own copy of the data, and one variable is not connected to another.

## Reference Types
Reference types store references to their data. Multiple variables can refer to the same object, so changes in one variable can affect another variable if they refer to the same object.

## Conclusion
Understanding these differences is crucial for effective memory management and predictable program behavior. Value types are typically used for simple data storage, while reference types are used for objects where multiple variables must be able to manipulate the same data.
