# Arrays

## Overview
Arrays are fundamental data structures in C# that store collections of items of the same type. This guide demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in C#.

## Key Array Operations
- **Declaration**: Specifies the type of elements and the number of elements that an array can hold.
- **Initialization**: Assigns values to the array elements either during declaration or at a later time.
- **Accessing Elements**: Retrieves or modifies elements at specific indices using the square bracket notation.
- **Traversal**: Iterates through each element in the array using loops.

## Example
The provided code in `Program.cs` demonstrates an array of integers. It includes examples of:

- Declaring an integer array with initial values.
- Accessing and printing all elements using a `foreach` loop.
- Modifying an element at a specific index.
- Iterating through the array with a `for` loop to print the modified elements.

## Running the Example
To run the example:

1. Copy the code into a new C# project in your development environment.
2. Build and run the program.
3. Observe the output that displays the elements of the integer array before and after modification.
## Conclusion
Understanding arrays is crucial for working with collections of data where the size is known in advance. Arrays provide a fast and efficient way to access and manipulate sets of variables.
