# Type Casting in C#
This section covers the concept of type casting in C#, showcasing how to convert between different data types. Type casting is essential when you want to assign values of one data type to another and there are two forms to consider: implicit (automatic) and explicit (manual).

# Implicit Casting
Implicit casting automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one, such as converting an `int` to a `double`. This is safe and does not require a special syntax.

# Explicit Casting
Explicit casting, on the other hand, must be done manually, converting a larger data type to a smaller one, such as a `double` to an `int`. This can potentially result in data loss and requires cast notation.

# Type Conversion Methods
Beyond these, C# provides built-in methods to convert between different non-compatible types. For example, you can convert an `int` to a `string` or a `double` to an `int`. These methods provide a safe and reliable way to cast between different data types.

Each section explains the principles and provides examples of how to perform these conversions, ensuring a clear understanding of type casting in C#.
