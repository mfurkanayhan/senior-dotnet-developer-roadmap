# Operators

Provides an overview of how various operators are used in C# to perform operations such as arithmetic, assignment, and string manipulation.

## Overview of Operators

- **Assignment Operators (`=`)**: Used to assign values to variables.
- **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)**: Used to perform mathematical calculations.
- **Unary Operators (`++`, `--`)**: Used to increment or decrement values.
- **String Concatenation (`+`)**: Used to combine strings.
- **String Interpolation (`${}`)**: Provides a readable way to embed variables in strings.
- **Verbatim String (`@`)**: Used to include special characters in strings without escaping them.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to use these operators effectively is crucial in C# programming, as they allow you to manipulate data and control the flow of your programs efficiently.
